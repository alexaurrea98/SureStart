## Reflections
#### Day 1: 02.08.2021
I am very excited to be part of Vail spring 2021! What caught my attention about this program in the first place was the fact that it's centered around AI and ML. I recently changed to a computer engineering degree and was wanting to take some machine learning classes, however, my schedule won't allow me to. In this year's VAIL program I hope to learn how to work with AI and deep learning. I also hope to not be intimmidated by this field of study. Lastly, I want to see what I am capable of during the makeathon. I look forward to meeting and working with great people and hope to stay connected for years to come!

#### Day 2: 02.09.2021
Today was great! I got to meet my mentor and he was very nice and helpful. I enjoyed reading about ML. The article made ML a little less intimidating as it explained how mathematical models are used to create these complex problem solvers. It was also helpful to learn the difference between supervised and unsupervised ML methods because we will need to decide which to use for specific problems. Unsupervised learning has to do with building prediction models that find patterns within the data. Supervised learning creates these models with a given patter - data already provided The learning activiy in Jupyter was also very helpeful. I was able to install different pyhton modules I did not have before. Overall, very informative. It is incorrect to say that SciKit may visualize data without other python libraries because it uses those modules to create the data visualization. It works really well with them, but it does not replace them.

### Day 3: 02.10.2021
Wow, this tensorflow tutorial!! Basically, I understood a tensor to be a compialation of vectors or matrices. That is kind of a basic and generalized definition. I was kind of confused on how tensors and matrices were different. From what I was able to understand, a matrix can be a tensor but a tensor can't necesarily be a matrix. A tensor is more specific where it has to be m^n number of elements, but a matix doesn't necesarily need to. A tensor also has the ability to transform when interacting with other mathematics. This is where it is useful to use tensors for deep learning. A lot of real world problems have many variables and data. Most of the times it is not sufficient to use 3D arrays to store datasets. Tensors are good at storing this data and make it easy to manipulate in order to create ML models. In the tensorflow activity I noticed that there are a lot of layers to ML, but they can be broken down.
